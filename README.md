# SDEV 220 Final Project

Group project created by Areiahna Cooks, Audrina Ortega, and Henry Barcalow for the SDEV 220 course.

## Current project ideas:

- Music practice tracker (for Sweetwater?) -- instrument, date, time practiced, song practiced; sort by instrument, date, song
- School planner (for Ivy Tech) -- assignment, date; make it like a clocking-in system?
- Project tracker (for Ivy Tech) -- task cards, project summary, team management
